```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(GGally)
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

### Exploring the dataset 

```{r}
# column names
names(diamonds)

# checkin out the dimentions
dim(diamonds)

# looking at everything 
summary(diamonds)

# top six lines 
head(diamonds)

# looking at teh last six lines 
tail(diamonds)

#another way to look at summary stuff 
skimr::skim(diamonds)

```

### And now we are making a plot 

```{r}
GGally::ggpairs(data = diamonds) # jeez this thing is intense 
```

### And now a ggplot of price v size 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point()
```

### And now  histogram of the `carat` column

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
